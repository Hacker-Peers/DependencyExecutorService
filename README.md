## Description
This project is a library that aims to facilitate the management of tasks having dependencies with one another.

In it's first iteration, it will only aim at removing the usual boilerplate code necessary for waiting after the other tasks, but in future versions we might also try to add execution order optimisations and even the automatic passing of job results to the dependent job.
